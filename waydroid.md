# For issues with Waydroid.

## General reminders
- It will not work without a wayland-capable desktop.
- It will not work in kernel versions older than `6.0`.
- It only has support for Android versions 11 and 13 because it uses AOSP-based LineageOS. If you want to run any apps that can't run in those versions, you're out of luck.
- Certain Android games, like CoDM, have anticheats that prevent them from running on any kind of emulator or VM. Those will also prevent you from running them on Waydroid.
